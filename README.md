[Lifebyte](http://lifebyte.org/) - Computer Ministry
================================

History
--------
Lifebyte was founded in 2000 as an outreach ministry of [Colorado Community Church](http://www.coloradocommunity.org).

The mission is to help Denver metro area people with their computer needs.

We are a Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher.

We are staffed entirely by volunteers just like you.

Current Work
-------------

We plan a delivery day once a month. We try to deliver around 20 PC's.

Twice a year we have a "PC Wash". Some groups wash cars, we wash PC's by blowing out the dust, and running virus checks. This is our fundraiser to cover our costs. Our costs include the storage unit, Windows licenses, and recycling.

We meet once a month just to keep the ministry on track and plan upcoming events.

We Need You
------------

E-mail us at [webmaster@lifebyte.org](mailto:webmaster@lifebyte.org) or call our voice mail at 303-256-1224.

There are several teams that you can join. 

* Donations - The donations team collects the donations. Anything we cannot use is recycled through our partner [Luminous Recycling](http://www.luminousrecycling.com/wp/).

* Builders go to the storage unit and pick up equipment. We rebuild the computers and get them ready for delivery.

* Delivery - No matter what team you are on, you should join us for deliveries. The more people we have at the delivery day, the more computers we can provide to the Denver community. This is also you chance to be a blessing, pray with people, and see if they have any needs beyond the computer that our church can help them with.

* Servants - If you are helping with this website. You are a servant. If you are the leader of Lifebyte, you are a servant. The servant team is the glue that holds this ministry together.
