<h1>Welcome</h1>    
    <p>
        Whether you have computers you'd like to donate, time you'd like to share with us
        or provide financial support, you've come to the right page!
    </p>
    <p>
        Lifebyte is composed of a group of spiritual techies who use the gifts and direction
        of God to acquire, restore and deliver free computers to those without.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are a mission who believes in helping our local Denver and world communities.
        Your support will give individuals and families in the Denver area and around the
        world hope and opportunities through computers.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are stewards of the environment recycling over 9,960 pounds (4 tons) of computer
        equipment through <a href="http://www.luminousrecycling.com/wp/">Luminous Recycling</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through the grace of God and the generosity of our supporters, we have provided
        over 450 computers to those without since our ministry began six years ago:
